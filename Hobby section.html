            <h1>Drawing</h1>
            <p>Painting is a visual art.</p>
            <p>The instruments used to make a drawing are pencils, crayons, pens with inks, brushes with paints, or combinations of
            these, and in more modern times, computer styluses with graphics tablets or gamepads in VR drawing software.A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support
            for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, vellum, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board,
            have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard.</p>
